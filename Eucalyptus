Eucalyptus : Elastic Utility Computing Architecture Linking your Program To Useful System
Eucalyptus is paid and open-source computer software for building Amazon Web Services (AWS)-compatible private and hybrid cloud computing environments, originally developed by the company Eucalyptus Systems. 


Goals for Eucalyptus
    1. Foster greater understanding and uptake of cloud computing
    2. Homogenize local IT environment with Public Clouds
    3. Provide a basic software development platform for the open source community
 Not designed as a replacement technology for AWS or any other Public Cloud service 
 
 Eucalyptus features include:

    Supports both Linux and Windows virtual machines (VMs).
    Application program interface- (API) compatible with Amazon EC2 platform.
    Compatible with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Simple Storage Service (S3).
    Works with multiple hypervisors including VMware, Xen and KVM.
    Can be installed and deployed from source code or DEB and RPM packages.
    Internal processes communications are secured through SOAP and WS-Security.
    Multiple clusters can be virtualized as a single cloud.
    Administrative features such as user and group management and reports.

Architecture:
    Eucalyptus is an open source software platform for implementing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in a private or 
    hybrid cloud computing environment.

System Requirements
   1.Physical Machines: All Eucalyptus services must be installed on physical servers, not virtual machines.
   2.Each machine in your network needs a minimum of 160GB of storage. 
   3.All Eucalyptus components must have at least one Network Interface Card (NIC) for a base-line deployment.
    For better network isolation and scale,the CC should have two NICs (one facing the CLC/user network and one facing the NC/VM network).
