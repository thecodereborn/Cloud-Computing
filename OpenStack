--------------------------------------OPENSTACK--------------------------------------------

1.Introduction : 

OpenStack is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, 
all managed through a dashboard that gives administrators control while empowering their users to provision resources through
a web interface.


2.Architecture :  mostly deployed as infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), whereby virtual servers and other resources are made available
                to customers
                
3.Services and components : 
  3.1	Compute (Nova)
  3.2	Networking (Neutron)
  3.3	Block storage (Cinder)

  Summary : 
        • Free and open-source cloud-computing software platform 
        • Provides services for managing a Cloud environment on the fly.
        • Consists of a group of interrelated projects that control pools of processing, storage, and networking resources
        • Provides users methods and support to deploy virtual  machines in a remote environment.
        • State in OpenStack is maintained in centrally managedrelational database (MySQL or MariaDB).
