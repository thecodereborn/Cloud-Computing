Google App Engine is a cloud computing technology for hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers.
Google App Engine makes it easy to build and deploy an application that runs reliably even under heavy load and with large amounts of data. 
Goals for GAE:
   1. Zero to sixty: Scale your app automatically without worrying about managing machines.
   2. Supercharged APIs: Supercharge your app with services such as Task Queue, XMPP, and Cloud SQL, all powered by the same infrastructure that powers the Google services you use every day.
   3. You're in control: Manage your application with a simple, web-based dashboard allowing you to customize your app's performance.

Architecture:
  Google App Engine is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering for Java, Python, Go and PHP in its standard environment. 


System Requirements
OS:- Windows, Linux, Mac Os.


It includes the following features:

  Persistent storage with queries, sorting, and transactions.
  Automatic scaling and load balancing.
  Asynchronous task queues for performing work outside the scope of a request.
  Scheduled tasks for triggering events at specified times or regular intervals.
  Integration with other Google cloud services and APIs.

WORKING:
 Applications are sandboxed and run across multiple servers. 
 App Engine offers automatic scaling for web applicationsâ€”as the number of requests increases for an application, 
 App Engine automatically allocates more resources for the web application to handle the additional demand.
