  This is the basic structure of AWS EC2, where EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud. EC2 allow users to use virtual machines of different configurations as per their requirement. It allows various configuration options, mapping of individual server, various pricing options, etc. 
  We will discuss these in detail in AWS Products section. Following is the diagrammatic representation of the architecture.
